_On a terminal, you'll run the .exe file using a C# compiler._

_I used two programming languages to accomplish this task._

_The grade_calculator.cs and the grade_calculator_two.cs are two different programs, the former represents first semester details, the latter represents second. Same with their respective .exe's. Run one at a time, in the future I'll find a way to merge them correctly._
